# What's this
* A package definition (or [derivations](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/derivations.html) as they named)
* of [npiperelay](https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay) (though [albertony's fork](https://github.com/albertony/npiperelay) is used, as it's more maintained i guess?)
* for the [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) package manager.
